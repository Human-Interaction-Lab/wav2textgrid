Description: Allows the direct usage of open source tools including OpenAI's Whisper
    model, to create a transcribed textgrid for Wav files. It is currently
    designed to work with conversations with two individuals with two channels
    in the wav file. It is built on a set of Python scripts run in R using
    the `reticulate` package. As such, code can pulled and run directly in Python
    as well.
